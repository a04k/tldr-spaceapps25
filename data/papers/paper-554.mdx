Background: Dirigent protein (DP) discovery gave new paradigm for monolignol-derived coupling in planta. Results: (+)-Pinoresinol-forming DP (PsDRR206) three-dimensional structure was obtained at 1.95 Å resolution. Conclusion: The tightly packed trimeric DP has three putative substrate binding sites spatially far apart, suggesting that each site involves monomer coupling directly. Significance: New insights into monolignol radical-radical coupling in planta . Keywords: Crystallography, Homology Modeling, Molecular Docking, Protein Crystallization, Secondary Metabolism, Dirigent Proteins, Phenoxy Radical Radical Coupling
