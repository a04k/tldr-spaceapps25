Significance Investigations of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans give powerful insights into fundamental biological processes that are conserved across species. Locomotion of this model organism is used to assess muscular and neural defects and score impacts of genetic mutations and pharmacological interventions. Existing analyses of the nematode gait have been focused on 2D locomotion, and 3D motion remains largely unexplored. We identify and mathematically describe a unique 3D behavioral pattern in burrowing and swimming—a roll maneuver—which, in combination with 2D turns, allows the nematode to explore bulk media. Our results provide important insights into 3D neuromuscular actuation and may be used to develop better assays for locomotion phenotype analysis. Keywords: Caenorhabdtis elegans , undulatory locomotion, 3D gait, maneuverability, behavior
