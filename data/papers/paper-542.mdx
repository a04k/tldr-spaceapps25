Significance Ca 2+ signaling is closely linked to the triggering of plant immune responses. We show that when the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 is used to trigger immune responses in mutants missing tonoplast Ca 2+ pumps, it causes disrupted Ca 2+ signals that are higher in amplitude than expected from wild-type plants. Relocalization of a Ca 2+ pump normally found in the plasma membrane to the tonoplast rescues both the tonoplast pump knockout mutantâ€™s immune-related phenotypes and aberrant Ca 2+ signaling dynamics. These observations support the notion that tonoplast-localized pumps are critical for the proper maintenance of Ca 2+ dynamics in innate immune responses but that any regulatory systems specific to the endogenous tonoplast pumps may not be required to support these signaling events.
