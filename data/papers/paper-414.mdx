This review covers advances made in genome mining SMs produced by Aspergillus nidulans , Aspergillus fumigatus , Aspergillus niger , and Aspergillus terreus in the past six years (2012–2018). Genetic identification and molecular characterization of SM biosynthetic gene clusters, along with proposed biosynthetic pathways, is discussed in depth.
