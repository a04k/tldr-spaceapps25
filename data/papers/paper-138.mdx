ABSTRACT The draft genome sequences of six Bacillus strains, isolated from the International Space Station and belonging to the Bacillus anthracis - B. cereus - B. thuringiensis group, are presented here. These strains were isolated from the Japanese Experiment Module (one strain), U.S. Harmony Node 2 (three strains), and Russian Segment Zvezda Module (two strains).
