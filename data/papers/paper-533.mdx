Simple Summary As global temperatures rise due to climate change, understanding how bacteria respond to heat is essential. Bacteria are critical to ecosystems, helping recycle nutrients, break down organic matter, and support plant growth. If they struggle to adapt to warmer conditions, the effects could ripple through ecosystems. Our study tested whether Bacillus bacteria, common in soil and water, could adapt to gradual temperature increases. We exposed seven strains from two groups to experimental evolution under increasing warming conditions, expecting them to evolve heat tolerance. Although some bacteria showed small improvements in heat tolerance, neither group could evolve to grow well at temperatures just three degrees Celsius above their natural range. This is concerning, as climate change could raise global temperatures by 2–4 °C, which could push these bacteria beyond their limits. We also found that c-di-AMP, a molecule that helps regulate potassium levels in cells, was involved in temperature tolerance. These findings highlight the vulnerability of essential bacteria to climate change and underscore the need for further research to predict and mitigate its impacts on ecosystems. Keywords: experimental evolution, critical high temperature, phenotypic plasticity, norms of reaction to temperature, convergent evolution, c-di-AMP, upper thermal limit, evolutionary rescue, thermal plasticity, thermal niche
