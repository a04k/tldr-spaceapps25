The whole-genome sequences (WGS) of 28 isolates from the International Space Station were generated and identified as Rhodotorula mucilaginosa , a pigmented yeast that has been classified as an emerging human pathogen in recent times. These WGS enable the identification of genes responsible for synthesizing compounds with biological implications.
