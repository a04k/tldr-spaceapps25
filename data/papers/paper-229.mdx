Multiple strains of a novel yeast belonging to genus Naganishia were isolated from environmental surfaces aboard the International Space Station (ISS). These strains exhibited a phenotype similar to Titan cell (~10 Âµm diameter) morphology when grown under a combination of simulated microgravity and 5% CO 2 conditions. Confocal, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy revealed distinct morphological differences between the microgravity-grown cells and the standard Earth gravity-grown cells, including larger cells and thicker cell walls, altered intracellular morphology, modifications to extracellular fimbriae, budding, and the shedding of bud scars. Phylogenetic analyses via multi-locus sequence typing indicated that these ISS strains represented a single species in the genus Naganishia and were clustered with Naganishia diffluens . The name Naganishia tulchinskyi is proposed to accommodate these strains, with IF6SW-B1 T as the holotype. The gene ontologies were assigned to the cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, suggesting a variety of phenotypes that are well suited to respond to microgravity and radiation. Genomic analyses also indicated that the extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were among the highest cellular component results, thus implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the highest molecular function matches included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity.
