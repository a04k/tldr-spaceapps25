Highlight How the polyamine cadaverine alters plant development is poorly understood. Here it is shown that natural variation in ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 affects root length sensitivity to exogenous cadaverine. Key words: Arabidopsis , cadaverine, natural variation, polyamines, roots, transporter.
