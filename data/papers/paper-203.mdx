The oocytes of the African clawed frog ( Xenopus laevis ) comprise one of the most widely used membrane protein expression systems. While frequently used for studies of transporters and ion channels, the application of this system to the study of mechanosensitive ion channels has been overlooked, perhaps due to a relative abundance of native expression systems. Recent advances, however, have illustrated the advantages of the oocyte system for studying plant and bacterial mechanosensitive channels. Here we describe in detail the methods used for heterologous expression and characterization of bacterial and plant mechanosensitive channels in Xenopus oocytes. Keywords: Mechanosensitive ion channel, Heterologous expression, Xenopus laevis oocytes, Patch-clamp electrophysiology, Pressure-clamp
