ABSTRACT Sphingomonadaceae are common membrane colonizers and biofilm formers. As part of our studies on long-term genetic changes in drinking water biofilm species, we report the draft genome sequence of Sphingomonas strain Sph5, isolated from a tap water filtration membrane. The isolate was determined as Sphingomonas paucimobilis through whole genome sequencing and de novo assembly. KEYWORDS: draft genome, WGS, water, Sphingomonas
