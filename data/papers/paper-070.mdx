SUMMARY Cadaverine, a polyamine, has been linked to modification of root growth architecture and response to environmental stresses in plants. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of root growth by cadaverine are largely unexplored. Here we conducted a forward genetic screen and isolated a mutation, cadaverine hypersensitive 3 ( cdh3 ), which resulted in increased root‐growth sensitivity to cadaverine, but not other polyamines. This mutation affects the BIO3‐BIO1 biotin biosynthesis gene. Exogenous supply of biotin and a pathway intermediate downstream of BIO1, 7,8‐diaminopelargonic acid, suppressed this cadaverine sensitivity phenotype. An in vitro enzyme assay showed cadaverine inhibits the BIO3‐BIO1 activity. Furthermore, cadaverine‐treated seedlings displayed reduced biotinylation of Biotin Carboxyl Carrier Protein 1 of the acetyl‐coenzyme A carboxylase complex involved in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, resulting in decreased accumulation of triacylglycerides. Taken together, these results revealed an unexpected role of cadaverine in the regulation of biotin biosynthesis, which leads to modulation of primary root growth of plants. Keywords: polyamines, cadaverine, biotin, root architecture, Arabidopsis thaliana
