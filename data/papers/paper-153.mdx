The draft genome sequences of six eukaryotic microbial strains belonging to the class Tremellomycetes isolated from the International Space Station were assembled. Further characterization of these sequences will aid in the understanding of the influence of microgravity conditions on these organismsâ€™ potential pathogenicity.
