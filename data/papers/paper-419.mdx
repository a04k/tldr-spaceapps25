Significance Mechanisms that determine the cellular volume allocated to organelles are largely unknown. We demonstrate that in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana , a small gene family that encodes proteins of unknown function contributes to a mechanism that establishes the proportion of cellular volume devoted to chloroplasts. We show that this mechanism resides outside of the chloroplast by demonstrating that the protein that makes the greatest contribution to this mechanism resides in the cytoplasm and nucleus and that the trafficking of this protein between the cytoplasm and nucleus may regulate this mechanism. A deeper understanding of this mechanism may lead to the rational manipulation of chloroplast compartment size, which may lead to more efficient photosynthesis and increased yields from important crop plants. Keywords: chloroplast coverage, chloroplast, plastid signaling, chlorophyll, Arabidopsis
