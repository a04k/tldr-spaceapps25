The draft whole-genome sequences (WGS) of 30 fungal strains isolated from the International Space Station and belonging to the Penicillium and Aspergillus genera were assembled. The WGS will allow for detailed genomic characterization to determine the possible applications and importance for space and biotechnological industries.
