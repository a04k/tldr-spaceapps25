Despite surging interest in space travel in recent decades, the impacts of prolonged, elevated exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health remain poorly understood. This form of ionizing radiation causes significant changes to biological systems including damage to DNA structure by altering epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation. Building on previous work by Kennedy et al. (Sci Rep 8(1): 6709. 10.1038/S41598-018-24755-8), we evaluated spatial DNA methylation patterns triggered by high-LET ( 56 Fe, 28 Si) and low-LET (X-ray) radiation and the influence of chromosome positioning and epigenetic architecture in distinct radial layers of cell nucleus. Next, we validated our results using gene expression data of mice irradiated with simulated GCR and JAXA astronauts. We showed that primarily 56 Fe induces a persistent DNA methylation increase whereas 28 Si and X-ray induce a decrease DNA methylation which is not persistent with time. Moreover, we highlighted the role of nuclear chromatin architecture in cell response to external radiation. In summary, our study provides novel insights towards epigenetic and transcriptomic response as well as chromatin multidimensional structure influence on galactic cosmic radiation damage.
